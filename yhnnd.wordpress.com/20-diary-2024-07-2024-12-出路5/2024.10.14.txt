Yesterday I waited for a whole afternoon for the IFT-5 of SpaceX's starship. In the evening I went to my company to do some fitness. And in the evening I went to FangZhiTsing's home to wash my bed's sheet. When I was walking on the dark street of the Dongtan Village I watched the Live relay of the launching of the aircraft and just minutes after the launching the chopsticks of launching tower re-captured the Super Heavy booster perfectly. I was so excited to witness this happening and I could not fall asleep the whole night until dawn. This is a critical moment in human history. This is a historical day. It marks the free world surpassed the Evil Axis by a great leap forward. And Trump will definitely become the 47th president of the United States of America. And Elon Musk and SpaceX will step by step lead mankind toward a road to become a multi-planetary specie. And when our adversaries are collapsing on the ground, we on the contrary are exploring the universe. We will occupy the Moon and eventually occupy Mars. Therefore when we are expanding our realms, the commies are falling. They will eventually be defeated. We will be elected. We will win this war.
