8th Oct. 2024 (Ada Lovelace Day).

There is no Sun in the sky and there is smog in the air. I went to the company very early in the morning and feel energetic because I just went back here from Peking after a long holiday. My AirPods (4th gen) were delivered to GLP I Park and I went down to receive the goods. I checked out the brand new AirPods with FangZhiTsing. LoongJingYi became more beautiful after the 7-day holiday. MengXiangDong came to GLP I Park Xi'an today. It rained in the afternoon. In the evening I went home by taxi and I received 2 credit cards and a suitcase from China Merchants Bank. I owe more than 12962.67 RMB to the China Merchants Bank. I cancelled the planned Billiard balls game that I planned to play with FangZhiTsing because of the rainy weather. Elon Musk said to Tucker Carlson that he is ALL IN TRUMP on this 2024 presidential election.



9th Oct. 2024 (Leif Erikson Day).

I returned the iPhone SE 3rd Gen i purchased from Apple to the postman of China Post. That iPhone SE was purchased from Apple and it has flaws on the edge of its glass back cover. I cleansed the phone case of my iPhone SE 3rd Gen with water and toilet paper. It was purchased previously on Taobao APP. I put the AirPods (4th gen) into my ears and listen to the podcasts in the afternoon.
