This world is evil. This time is evil. We're living in the darkest era of human history. Good people were killed and evil dictators, evil kings, emperors, tyrants are ruling the world and people die every day. There are disasters. There are famine. There are wars. Some people said God has abandoned us. He won't. He will save us. God has a plan to save the world. And the plan won't be executed in one day. Nobody knows his plan, but his plan will be successful. There is no doubt that this plan is carrying out every day. In the end, all dictators, all evil people, evil Party and God's enemy will be destroyed. Those who don't believe in God will be destroyed, and God's own people shall be saved.
